Automated window and lag selection for Kronos parametrization

Experiment 1: Decompose the serie in the seasonality component than apply FFT over it in order to identify the signals that compose the seasonality. The strongest signals will be used for parametrization

Experiment 2: the same, but with autocorrelation function


=========== EXPERIMENT 1: SEASONALITY ================
Decomposing a TS in it's seasonality component:

    Chapter 6 - book [name]
    - There are several ways to decompose the series: classical way, X11, SEATS and STL
    - Classical Way: admits only yearly granularity. Should not be used
    - X11 and SEATS: Very robust to outliers, but admits only monthly and quaterly granularity
    - STL: admits any graularity, but only additive models
    
    Additive x multiplicative models:
    - Is additive if variance DO NOT change over time. Is multiplicative if it does.
    - Heteroschedasticity: the property of a series of being multiplicative
    - Therefore: if series is heteroschedastic, cannot use STL
        - In that case, a log transformation is needed to make series additive
    - Tests for HS: White Test and Breusch-Pagan Teste
        - The return are statistics for F-test. p-value is observed
    

    *** STL model needs parametrization ***
    Which defeats the purpose of automating automated window selection


SEASONALITY DECOMPOSITION TECHNIQUES
- Periodogram (unsmoothed Fast Fourier Transform)
- Power Spectrum Analysis (smoothed FFT) (Data should be detrended prior to analysis.)
- SingularSpectrum Analysis (paper sent by Thiago)
- |?| Fit a harmonic function using sin(t) and cos(t) as predictor
- Luis mentioned Wavelet
